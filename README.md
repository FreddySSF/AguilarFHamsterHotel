I happily reviewed Freedy's assignment. All of the big pieces of the skeleton for the website were completed, per say. In other words the outline, to the sections that were part of the formation of the site mockup were included. This great to see as he is tackling the project in its entirety, and then breaking down the section pieces in small segments to be able to digest or say work towards, more sections chipping away, at the objective. We can see that there is needed work to bring this project to a full completion. Every section needs additional touch ups to get us closer to the finish product, as I mention, however the portion of reserve a room allowed me to type my check in date, and all that useful information, that is great., beacuse I know how much work goes into this piece alone. 
From the web interaction point of view, when inspecting the page, its seems that the shrink of the page is working, and freddy is moving in the right direction, ultimately the interaction with the web interaction piece would be smoother if the mock up was at a finished stage. None the less, fredyy keep at it, your on the right path.
